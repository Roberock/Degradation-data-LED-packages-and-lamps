# Degradation-data-LED-packages-and-lamps
A database of anonimiyed degradation(longitudinal) and reliability data from several light-edmitting diodes packages and lamps, obtained from accelerated stress tests like from the IES LM-80 normative




![plot](/Descriptive_Tables_LED_data.png?raw=true)

* The first table contains a summary of the .csv data sheets including table sizes, tests duration, number of samples, number of distinct LED technologies, number of accelerated stress test.

* The second table indicate the measured response variables, accelerating factors and other device-specific parameters. Also, we indicate whether or not raw data (âœ”)  is available or only normalized flux (-) measurements are provided.
